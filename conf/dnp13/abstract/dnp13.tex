\textbf{QGP parameter extraction via a global analysis of event-by-event flow coefficient distributions} \\
Jonah E.\ Bernhard, Christopher E.\ Coleman-Smith, Peter W.\ Marcy, Steffen A.\ Bass \\


A primary goal of heavy-ion physics is the measurement of the quark-gluon plasma specific shear viscosity $\eta/s$.  Previous studies have placed bounds on $\eta/s$, typically by matching the centrality dependence of event-averaged $v_n$ coefficients between model and experiment.  The ATLAS experiment has recently measured event-by-event $v_n$ distributions, which could provide a much more sensitive probe of $\eta/s$.  Using a hybrid model with MC-Glauber and MC-KLN initial conditions, viscous 2+1D hydrodynamics, and the hadron cascade UrQMD, we calculate $v_n$ distributions over wide ranges of several model parameters including $\eta/s$.  By calibrating the model to data, we extract the optimal values of each parameter and clarify the important features of a physically accurate model.

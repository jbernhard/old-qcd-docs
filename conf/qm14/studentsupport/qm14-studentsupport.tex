\opening{Dear QM2014 Organizers,}


I am a third-year graduate student in the QCD theory group at Duke University.  My adviser is Steffen Bass.  I'm writing to request student
support for Quark Matter 2014.


My dissertation project is centered around a large-scale model-to-data comparison in which I extract rigorous constraints on fundamental QGP
properties.  
The latest high-quality experimental data---and understanding of how those data were measured and analyzed---are essential for meaningful,
accurate results.
Quark Matter provides an unparalleled opportunity for networking with the researchers who conducted the experiments and performed the data
analysis.

I have submitted an abstract \emph{QGP parameter extraction via a global analysis of event-by-event flow coefficient distributions}.

Student support would significantly alleviate the financial burden on the Duke group and facilitate my participation in Quark Matter 2014.




%I attended Quark Matter 2012 as a first-year student, which was extraordinarily helpful for my development as a heavy-ion physicist and
%understanding of the state of the field.  Now, I hope to experience a second Quark Matter---to continue my development, access the
%invaluable opportunities for networking and collaboration, and share my own work.  I have submitted an abstract 
%\emph{QGP parameter extraction via a global analysis of event-by-event flow coefficient distributions}.
%
%This may be my final opportunity to attend the premier conference in the field as a graduate
%student.  Student support would significantly alleviate the financial burden on the Duke group and facilitate my participation.



%  - take out the reference to the DC Quark Matter - you’re better off if they assume
%  that as a graduate student just past your prelim this might be your first QM…
%  
%  - take out the sentence about the last chance of attending a QM as graduate student,
%  I believe the one in Kobe is next year, and its likely that you’d still be a graduate
%  student and going there, then…
%  
%  - write a few sentences about your thesis topic, that your model to data comparison relies
%  on knowing the latest high quality experimental data and that attending QM provides you
%  with a unique opportunity to learn about that data, network with the researchers who
%  have done the measurements and whose knowledge of the analysis details is crucial for you
%  etc etc….



\closing{Sincerely, \\ Jonah Bernhard}
